# Team Collaboration Plan

## Communication
We will communicate using the **Discord app**, and I expect my partner to respond within **24 hours**.

## Meeting Schedule
We prefer to:
- Meet **in-person** after **Tuesday’s class (5–6 PM)**.
- Have an **online meeting** on **Saturday (10–11 AM)**.

In total, we plan to have **two meetings per week** outside of the lab.

## Personal Working Style
I prefer to **start tasks early**. Since **C1** was released this Wednesday, I will begin **reading the requirements and creating a plan** before next week. My plan is to start **writing code at the beginning of next week**.

## GitHub Workflow
I will push my work to GitHub every **two days (48 hours)**.

## Definition of a "Unit of Work"
A "unit of work" refers to completing a **specific, reviewable portion** of the project. For example:
- We can divide C1 into **four parts** as outlined in the C1 requirements.
- For each unit of work, we will:
1. Analyze the data file provided to understand the structure and data types.
2. Review the **sample queries** in the specification to determine how the data should be arranged.
3. Create **fake data** (e.g., for one section of one course) to build a prototype query processor for testing.
4. Write code to handle queries and return correct results and error codes.

Before starting any "unit of work," we will **communicate and share our thoughts** to ensure alignment.

## Hard Deadlines
There are a few deadlines that may reduce my capacity to contribute to the project:
- **January 30th and 31st:** I need to prepare for the **CPSC 310-Quiz0** on **January 31st (Friday)**.
- **January 31st:** I also have an **essay draft** due at **10 PM** for one of my communication courses.
- **Every Saturday:** I need to work on programming assignments for my **economics course**.

### Strategies for Managing Deadlines
To manage these constraints, I plan to:
- **Prioritize tasks** for C1 in advance.
- Break the work into **time-efficient tasks** that can be distributed throughout the week.
- Ensure I **push my work to GitHub** regularly to maintain steady progress.

## Collaboration Tips
I believe the most important factor for effective collaboration is to **avoid procrastination**. By strictly following our plan and communicating immediately when we encounter struggles or difficulties, we can stay on track and ensure the success of our project. Proactive and timely communication will be key to our team's success.
